digitale-briefwahl (0.2.0) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Add launcher app. This decreases the likelyhood that the ballot will be falsely detected
    as a virus on Windows systems.
  * Add launcher for Mac OS X (while it was supported previously it required starting from the
    command line which seemed to be too complicated for Mac users).
  * `wahl.ini` now comes with \r\n line endings to support editing with notepad on Windows.
  * Ballot written with Windows line endings to support editing with notepad on Windows.
  * Improve formatting of (empty) ballot.
  * Add random number to ballot so that two otherwise identical ballots encrypt differently.
  * Allow to select directory when writing files.
  * Allow abstention.
  * Sending of emails on Windows if MAPI is not configured. If MAPI fails we now try mailto:.
